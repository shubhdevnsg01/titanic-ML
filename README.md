This was my first Machine learning project that I made.
This project enumerates the probability of the survivors on the basis of various 
variables like age, gender, arrival on different ports etc.
I made it on google collab as it has a friendly user-interface and works smoothly on your pc
(if you dont have a strong pc, then google collab really helps)
It is a fairly common project but its good for beginners.
